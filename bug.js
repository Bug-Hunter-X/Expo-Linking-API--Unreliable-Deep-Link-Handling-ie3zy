This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links, particularly when dealing with universal links.  The app might not register the link correctly, leading to the link not opening the app or opening the wrong screen. This is often due to incorrect configuration of the `ios` and `android` sections in your `app.json` file, or problems with your server-side handling of the links.
